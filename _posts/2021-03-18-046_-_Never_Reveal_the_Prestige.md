 Cam Hackett and Lucien Brulé from Ramagine.com joined us to talk about their process of talking to  a lot of security researchers and reverse engineers to develop a NSF report (why yes we are trying to find/get our hands on it) and how they used what they found to create their RE sharing tool. We tackle the world of RE from a different perspective which includes the importance of  business development and what is market research.

<p>
 One of the largest takeaways they found was a 3.5 Million job gap  where RE skills are needed that is relatively hidden.
