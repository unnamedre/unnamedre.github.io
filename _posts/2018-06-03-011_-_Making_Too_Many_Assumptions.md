 This week
 <a href="http://bluetooth.expert/">
  Mike Ryan
 </a>
 (
 <a href="https://twitter.com/mpeg4codec">
  @mpeg4codec
 </a>
 ) joins us to talk about how he went from hacking games for stronger characters (we don’t reveal which ones; you’ll have to listen) to revealing big weaknesses in Bluetooth products.
</p>
<p>
 Mike gives us the rundown on how he ended up working on
 <a href="https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/">
  UbertOOth
 </a>
 ,  using
 <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">
  wireshark
 </a>
 , and how many UbertEEth you should use.  We discuss some of the biggest mistakes developers make in their Bluetooth and BLE products. He shares some examples of this through his prior
 <a href="https://github.com/mikeryan">
  work
 </a>
 including credit cards and skateboards. We also learn about CVEs including the one Mike has for the
 <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2247">
  Skateboard
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 If after this, you are worried that your next IoT product needs a security review or at least getting started with Ubertooth, you can go to the
