 M. Carlton joined us to talk about being part of leading professional reverse engineering team at
 <a href="http://senr.io/">
  Senr.io
 </a>
 . We discussed her Embedded Systems talk about IoT and in particular
 <a href="http://blog.senr.io/devilsivy.html">
  Devil’s Ivy
 </a>
 (Check out the important
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">
  ROP
 </a>
 video to better understand the key concept ). In this particular case, they found that the M300 camera model using
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSOAP">
  GSOAP
 </a>
 (
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">
  SOAP
 </a>
 ) parse for buffer overflow.
</p>
<p>
 Not only did this issue allow spread quickly as a DOS among the M300 cameras but over 200 other Axis cameras (Hurray for code-reuse) due to using the third party code library.
</p>
<p>
 M. uses several tools in her work:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  IDA Pro
 </li>

  </a>
 </li>
 <li>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nmap">
   Nmap
  </a>
 </li>
 <li>
  Debuggers like gdb
 </li>
 <li>
  Multimeters and oscilloscopes
 </li>
 <li>
  VMWare
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 She had some excellent suggestions for improving the odds of NOT getting hacked:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  Put a password on any consoles and let it be changeable.
 </li>
 <li>
  Anticipate issues by performing security reviews.
 </li>
 <li>
  Be wary of any third party libraries you use. If there are updates to these libraries, prepare to update quickly.
 </li>
 <li>
  Make sure your systems are field patchable/updateable, securely.
 </li>
 <li>
  Limit surface area. Limit the ability for others to analyze your system by removing/disabling consoles, UARTs, features, and JTAG interfaces.
 </li>
 <li>
  Put more gates/obstacles on how easily any found exploits can be used in the system.
 </li>
 <li>
  Unearth any default credentials used in your system and resolve.
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 In the worse case, plan in advance for a security breach to expedite deployment.
